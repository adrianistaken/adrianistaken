Hey! I'm Adrian, a tech enthusiast who loves to tinker and build cool stuff. I spend most of my days creating things, whether that's coding, YouTube videos, or game development. Iâ€™m all about making things that not only look good but feel great to use/consume.

When I give myself some free time, you can probably find me playing Dota 2. I run an educational YouTube channel where I dive deep into widely misunderstood and intersting mechanics.

Iâ€™m always up for learning new things, whether itâ€™s a new programming language or a game development trick. I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner with a bit of a creative streak. If you're the same, let's chat about it! I love learning from others :)

### What I Do

- **Frontend Development:** I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive web applications using modern frontend frameworks. I love collaboring with engineers and designers to build seamless user experiences.
  
- **Full Stack Development:** While my strength lies in frontend development, I also have experience working with backend technologies like Python and Django, allowing me to contribute to the entire stack.

- **Game Development:** Recently, I've been diving into game development using Godot. I'm creating a simple 2.5D game as a way to learn more about the game development process and experiment with new ideas.
